## 🌟 Why I Built This

I wanted to learn SQL but couldn't find a platform that made it **fun, interactive, and practical**. Most resources were either too theoretical or lacked real-world scenarios. So I created this playground to:

- 🎓 **Learn SQL** through hands-on practice with realistic data
- 🛠️ **Master Next.js** and modern web development
- 🔗 **Explore Supabase** and database integration
- 🎮 **Make learning enjoyable** with gamified challenges

Now I'm sharing it so others can learn and have fun too! 🚀

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Interactive Learning

- **SQL Editor** with syntax highlighting and auto-completion
- **Real-time query execution** with instant results
- **20+ curated exercises** from beginner to advanced
- **Database schema explorer** to understand table relationships

### 🎮 Challenge Mode

- **Data quality challenges** with intentional errors to find and fix
- **AI-powered challenge generator** with custom difficulty levels
- **Realistic scenarios** like e-commerce data validation
- **Configurable error rates** (2-25%) for progressive difficulty

### 🛠️ Flexible Database Setup

- **One-click database setup** with multiple configurations
- **Realistic datasets** with 50-2000+ records
- **Challenge databases** with data quality issues
- **Custom configurations** for specific learning goals

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX

- **Clean, responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Dark/light mode** support
- **Intuitive navigation** with tabs and organized sections
- **Real-time feedback** and error handling

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArnaudHalvick/sql-playground.git
   cd sql-playground
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment** ⚠️ **Service role key required!**

   ```bash
   # Copy the template
   cp .env.local.example .env.local

   # Fill in your Supabase credentials:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key  # Essential for DB setup!
   ```

4. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Setup database** (click "Setup Database" in the app or use CLI)
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup-medium  # Clean dataset
   npm run db:challenge-light  # With data quality issues
   ```

> **💡 Why service role key?** The app needs admin privileges to create tables, insert sample data, and set up the query execution function. Without it, database setup won't work!

## 🎯 Learning Path

### 🟢 Beginner (Start Here!)

- Basic SELECT queries and filtering
- Understanding table relationships
- Simple JOINs and aggregations

### 🟡 Intermediate (Level Up!)

- Complex JOINs and subqueries
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Date functions and data analysis

### 🔴 Advanced (Master Level!)

- Window functions and CTEs
- Data quality validation
- Performance optimization
- Real-world problem solving

## 🎮 Challenge Examples

### Find Invalid Emails

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, email
FROM users
WHERE email NOT LIKE '%@%.com'
   OR email NOT LIKE '%@%.net'
   OR email NOT LIKE '%@%.org';
```

### Detect Pricing Anomalies

```sql
SELECT name, price,
  CASE
    WHEN price < 0 THEN 'Negative price'
    WHEN price = 0 THEN 'Zero price'
    WHEN price > 10000 THEN 'Suspiciously high'
  END as issue
FROM products
WHERE price <= 0 OR price > 10000;
```

### Delivery Logic Violations

```sql
SELECT id, status, delivery_date
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'delivered' AND delivery_date IS NULL;
```
