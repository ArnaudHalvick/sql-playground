# Supabase Configuration for SQL Playground
# Copy this file to .env.local in your project root and fill in your values

# Required: Your Supabase project URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co

# Required: Your Supabase anonymous key (safe to expose in frontend)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Required: Your Supabase service role key (keep this secret!)
# This is ESSENTIAL for database setup, reset, and management operations
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Why do you need the service role key?
# 
# The SQL Playground needs admin privileges to:
# • Create and drop database tables
# • Insert sample data with realistic relationships
# • Create the run_query() function for SQL execution
# • Reset the database when needed
# • Set up challenge mode with data quality issues
#
# Without the service role key, the "Setup Database" feature won't work!

# 📋 How to get these values:
# 
# 1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard (https://supabase.com/dashboard)
# 2. Navigate to Settings > API
# 3. Copy the values from the "Project API keys" section:
#    • Project URL (at the top)
#    • anon/public key (for regular queries)
#    • service_role key (for database management)

# 🔐 Security Notes:
# 
# • The ANON key is safe to expose in your frontend code
# • The SERVICE_ROLE key should be kept secret and never exposed in frontend code
# • Only use the SERVICE_ROLE key for server-side operations and database management
# • Add .env.local to your .gitignore file (it should already be there)

# 🚀 Quick Setup:
# 
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.local.example .env.local
# 2. Fill in your Supabase credentials above
# 3. Run: npm run dev
# 4. Click "Setup Database" in the app or run: npm run db:setup
